# Status Log

## 2025-10-14
- Initialized tracking scheme; updated `SPEC.md` implementation phases and expanded coordination directives in `AGENTS.md`.
- Added this status log to capture ongoing progress, blockers, and next steps.
- Created feature branch `feature/phase-0-foundations` and confirmed `uv` tooling availability (`uv --version`, `uv run python -V`).
- Scaffolded package structure in `src/dorgy`, introduced Click-based CLI skeleton, and wired console entry point along with `python -m dorgy`.
- Updated `pyproject.toml` for package metadata, dependencies, `uv` management, and console script; regenerated `uv.lock`.
- Added baseline README guidance and marked Phase 0 status as in progress within `SPEC.md`.
- Standardized local Python to 3.11 by updating `.python-version`, so uv commands automatically use the compatible interpreter.
- Established pre-commit configuration (Ruff lint/format/imports, MyPy, `uv run pytest`), added tool configs in `pyproject.toml`, and documented workflow updates in README/AGENTS.
- Added scaffolding for configuration and state management modules (placeholders plus Pydantic models) with accompanying tests to keep future implementations guided.
- Documented Phase 1 scope and added resolver placeholders outlining precedence (CLI > env > file > defaults) along with tests asserting the current NotImplemented status.
- Next actions: outline CLI command behaviors for Phase 1, design the config load/save workflow ahead of implementation, and capture ingestion pipeline assumptions in SPEC.md.

## 2025-10-15
- Merged Phase 0 foundations into `main` and created `feature/phase-1-config` for the next stage of work.
- Updated `SPEC.md` to mark Phase 0 complete and Phase 1 in progress; captured ingestion pipeline assumptions.
- Implemented configuration persistence/resolution (file/env/CLI precedence), wired `dorgy config view|set|edit`, and added unit/CLI tests.
- Documented configuration usage in README/AGENTS to guide future contributors.
- Delivered state repository persistence helpers (`state.json`, `orig.json`, review/quarantine folders) with tests covering round-trips and error handling.
- Phase 1 complete; SPEC table updated accordingly. Upcoming focus: integrate configuration/state usage into future commands and begin Phase 2 ingestion scaffolding.

## 2025-10-16
- Created `feature/phase-2-ingestion` branch and expanded SPEC with detailed ingestion architecture goals/deliverables.
- Next actions: scaffold ingestion modules (`discovery`, `detectors`, `extractors`, `pipeline`), introduce Pydantic models for descriptors, and add placeholder tests.
- Wired ingestion pipeline into `dorgy org`, expanded metadata extraction for text/images/json, added CLI/state tests, and documented Phase 3 plan in SPEC.
- Upcoming focus: integrate classification pipeline (Phase 3) atop the ingestion outputs and enhance error handling/quarantine flows.
- Implemented locked-file copy/wait policies, oversized sampling, quarantine moves, and ingestion logging to `dorgy.log`; added tests covering these behaviours.

## 2025-10-17
- Started Phase 3 on `feature/phase-3-classification`; added classification models, DSPy engine scaffolding, and smoke tests obeying Google-style docstrings.
- Next actions: implement DSPy-backed classification, persist decisions into state, and extend CLI workflows to surface classification results.
- Implemented heuristic classification fallback, CLI integration (including rename toggle support), state persistence of decisions, and coverage for new behaviours.
- Added JSON-backed classification cache, confidence-based review routing, and optional DSPy activation via `DORGY_ENABLE_DSPY`.

## 2025-10-18
- Began Phase 4 organization engine: planner/executor scaffolding, rename conflict resolution, category-based moves, and undo/logging (`last_plan.json`).
- CLI `org` now previews/applies rename+move operations and logs details to `.dorgy/dorgy.log`.

## 2025-10-16 (cont.)
- Replaced all Python module/class/function docstrings with Google-style format across src/ and tests/ to standardize documentation quality.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` directives to mandate Google-style docstrings for future contributions.
- Ran `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` to validate formatting, linting, and tests prior to push.
- Next actions: audit SPEC.md for any docstring-related expectations that should be surfaced in upcoming phases.

## 2025-10-19
- Extended the organization planner to honour `organization.conflict_resolution` (append_number, timestamp, skip) with timestamp injection for tests and surfaced `plan.notes` through the CLI.
- Added timestamp/skip collision coverage to `tests/test_organization_scaffolding.py`, updated SPEC and organization AGENTS guidance, and confirmed behaviour via `uv run pytest`.
- Observed test suite summary: 37 passed, 1 skipped (DSPy optional dependency).
- Next actions: wire history playback into undo/status commands and outline transactional staging requirements before expanding to watch/mv integration for Phase 5.
- Persisted rename/move history events to `.dorgy/history.jsonl`, exposed `OperationEvent` models, and wired `StateRepository.append_history` with executor-generated records. Updated state tests/docs accordingly and re-ran `uv run pytest` (38 passed, 1 skipped) to verify the new logging.
- Captured ingestion snapshots into `.dorgy/orig.json` before organization runs, exposed them through `dorgy undo --dry-run`, and expanded CLI/state tests to cover the snapshot schema.
- Introduced staged execution for organization plans so renames/moves occur from `.dorgy/staging/<session>` with automatic rollback on failure; added regression tests covering successful runs and conflict restoration, then re-ran `uv run pytest` (40 passed, 1 skipped).
- Surfaced recent `.dorgy/history.jsonl` entries during `dorgy undo --dry-run`, added repository helpers for reading history, and verified the output/limit logic with dedicated tests (41 passed, 1 skipped).
- Implemented `dorgy org --output PATH` relocation by copying organized files into the target directory, preserving originals and persisting state/history under the destination `.dorgy`; updated CLI/executor to support copy-mode staging and added integration coverage.
- Added `dorgy undo --json` for machine-readable rollback previews/results, serialising plans, snapshots, and recent history; expanded CLI tests to assert JSON payload shape (43 passed, 1 skipped).
- Introduced `dorgy status` for read-only collection summaries (text/JSON) leveraging state, history, and snapshot metadata; documented the command and validated output via new CLI tests (46 passed, 1 skipped).

## 2025-10-20
- Delivered Phase 4.5 CLI polish: shared summary helpers, `--summary/--quiet` toggles, standardised JSON error payloads, and executed `dorgy org --json` parity covering plan/state/history details.
- Added a `cli` configuration block (quiet/summary defaults, status history limit), refreshed README/SPEC guidance, and expanded tests for precedence plus new summary/quiet behaviours.
- Extended CLI integration coverage for JSON error responses and quiet defaults; `uv run pytest` now reports 51 passed, 1 skipped.
- Next actions: begin Phase 5 watch service planning and extend the polished UX patterns to upcoming watch/mv/search commands.

## 2025-10-21
- Implemented Phase 5 watch service (`dorgy watch`) with `--once`, JSON/quiet/summary parity, and configurable debounce/backoff sourced from `processing.watch` defaults.
- Added `WatchService` to batch filesystem events, reuse the ingestion/classification/organization pipeline, and persist incremental updates to `.dorgy/state.json`, `.dorgy/history.jsonl`, and `.dorgy/watch.log`.
- Documented the workflow in SPEC/README/AGENTS (including module-specific guidance) and introduced CLI integration tests in `tests/test_cli_watch.py` covering one-shot and JSON flows.
- Updated SPEC phase tracking and configuration snippets and refreshed README highlights to surface the new watch behaviour.
