# Status Log

## 2025-10-14
- Initialized tracking scheme; updated `SPEC.md` implementation phases and expanded coordination directives in `AGENTS.md`.
- Added this status log to capture ongoing progress, blockers, and next steps.
- Created feature branch `feature/phase-0-foundations` and confirmed `uv` tooling availability (`uv --version`, `uv run python -V`).
- Scaffolded package structure in `src/dorgy`, introduced Click-based CLI skeleton, and wired console entry point along with `python -m dorgy`.
- Updated `pyproject.toml` for package metadata, dependencies, `uv` management, and console script; regenerated `uv.lock`.
- Added baseline README guidance and marked Phase 0 status as in progress within `SPEC.md`.
- Standardized local Python to 3.11 by updating `.python-version`, so uv commands automatically use the compatible interpreter.
- Established pre-commit configuration (Ruff lint/format/imports, MyPy, `uv run pytest`), added tool configs in `pyproject.toml`, and documented workflow updates in README/AGENTS.
- Added scaffolding for configuration and state management modules (placeholders plus Pydantic models) with accompanying tests to keep future implementations guided.
- Next actions: outline CLI command behaviors for Phase 1, design the config load/save workflow ahead of implementation, and capture ingestion pipeline assumptions in SPEC.md.
